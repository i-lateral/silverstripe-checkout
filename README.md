=========================

## DEPRECIATED NOTICE

**As of version 3.0, this module has been merged into the [silverstripe-orders](https://github.com/i-lateral/silverstripe-orders) module**

Provides a shopping cart interface to a Silverstripe install that allows
users to add items to a shopping cart, enter their personal details and
make payments.

## Dependancies

* [Grid Field Extensions](https://github.com/ajshort/silverstripe-gridfieldextensions)
* [VersionedDataObjects](https://github.com/heyday/silverstripe-versioneddataobjects)

**NOTE** This module will need **either** the [CMS module](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-cms),
or the [siteconfig](https://github.com/i-lateral/silverstripe-siteconfig) modules installed, or you will get an error.

## Also Integrates With

* Silverstripe Subsites

## Order Admin

If you would like to generate custom orders, that can be tracked in the
admin interface, then you will need to install the silverstripe orders
module as well.
